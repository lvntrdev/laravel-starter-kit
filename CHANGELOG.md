## [13.2.4] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed

- **Type-safety sweep** — source now passes `vue-tsc --noEmit` and `eslint 'resources/js/**/*.{ts,vue}'` with zero errors and zero warnings.
    - `SkDatatable.vue` `activeFilters` widened to a single `FilterValue` union (`string | number | Date | (Date | null)[] | null`); DatePicker filters migrated from `v-model` to `:model-value` + `@update:model-value` with narrow casts.
    - `:icon` expression coerces trailing null to `undefined`; `datatable.records_info` pagination params are passed through `String(... ?? 0)` to match i18n string arguments.
    - `SelectOption` cast in `SkFormInput.vue` routed through `unknown`.
    - `router.reload({ preserveScroll: true })` calls reduced to `router.reload()` (Inertia v3 preserves scroll/state on reload by default).
- **Typed shared props aligned with runtime shape** — `SharedPageProps` gained a `[key: string]: unknown` index signature so it satisfies Inertia's `PageProps` constraint; `env.d.ts` now declares `sharedPageProps.auth` as `{ user, role, role_names, permissions }` plus `appEnv / appDebug / locale / availableLocales`.
- **Page-level prop/type fixes** — `Dashboard/Index.vue` reads `user?.first_name` (real field) instead of a non-existent `user?.name`; `Settings/Index.vue` declares `logo_url: string | null` on the `general` shape; `RoleForm.vue` calls Wayfinder as `update.url({ id: props.role!.id! })`.
- **ESLint warnings cleared** — `Breadcrumb.rootLabel`, `FileGrid.emptyLabel` and `SkTag.{value, icon, color, severity}` have `withDefaults` fallbacks; `SkDatatable` `v-html` usage is marked with a reasoned `eslint-disable-next-line` (render string is author-defined, `escapeHtml` helper is exposed).

### Changed

- **tsconfig deduplication** — `tsconfig.json` excludes `packages/**` and adds a new `"@lvntr/components/*"` path that resolves first to `resources/js/components/Lvntr-Starter-Kit/*` with a fallback to the package copy; the previous dual-include produced duplicate type-check errors for every synced component.
- **Vite `Components` plugin is single-source** — the `dirs` entry was trimmed to `resources/js/components` only; the package path is gone. The auto-generated `components.d.ts` now references source paths.
