# Changelog

All notable changes to `lvntr/laravel-starter-kit` will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [13.2.6] - 2026-04-15

### Added

- **Two new global helpers** — `definition($key, $value)` returns the matching record (object) from `DefinitionService`; `definitionLabel($key, $value)` returns its `label`. Useful for resolving enum-style values to display strings without re-fetching the definition list per call. Both ship from `vendor/lvntr/laravel-starter-kit/src/sk-helpers.php` and are autoloaded automatically.
- **`sk:publish --tag=helpers`** — publishes the package's `sk-helpers.php` into `app/Helpers/sk-helpers.php` so consumers can override or extend the bundled helpers without forking. The vendor file detects the published copy at autoload time and routes through it via `require_once`; a realpath guard prevents self-recursion. No `composer.json` change is needed. Deleting the published file reverts to the vendor implementation immediately.
- **Friendly file manager validation messages** — `UploadFileRequest` now overrides `attributes()` and `messages()`. Each `files.{i}` slot is bound to the file's `getClientOriginalName()`, so toasts show `vacation.jpg yüklenemedi: …` instead of `files.0`. Mimetypes / max-size errors map to translation keys with a readable extension list (`İzinli tipler: WEBP, PDF, JPG, …`) and human-friendly size limit (`en fazla 10 MB`). New keys: `errors.upload_invalid_type`, `errors.upload_too_large`, `errors.upload_invalid_file`.

### Changed

- **Helpers reorganized** — `to_api()` and `format_date()` (plus the two new helpers) now ship from the package vendor. End-user apps no longer keep a `to_api` copy under `app/`. The new `app/Helpers/custom.php` is published into the consumer app on first install and added to the app's `composer.json` `autoload.files`; it is *never* overwritten by `sk:update` so user code is preserved across upgrades.
- **`app/helpers.php` deprecated** — `sk:update` compares the existing file's md5 against a list of known stock hashes; a stock copy is removed silently. A user-modified copy is left in place with a console warning so user code is not destroyed. The `composer.json` autoload entry is rewritten only when the file is actually gone.
- **`InstallCommand` injects helpers autoload entry** — fresh installs now have `app/Helpers/custom.php` registered in `composer.json` `autoload.files` automatically. Idempotent: re-running `sk:install` is a no-op once injected. Legacy `app/helpers.php` entries are rewritten to `app/Helpers/custom.php` in the same step.

### Fixed

- **File manager toasts now actually surface** — every `toast.add()` call in `FileManager.vue` was missing `group: 'bc'`, so the shared `ToastComponent` (mounted with `group="bc"`) silently dropped them. Folder create/rename/delete/move and file upload toasts (success and error) all show again.
- **Server-side validation errors reach the user** — the upload XHR previously read only `envelope.message` (the generic "Validation error.") on a 422. The composable now walks `envelope.errors` and surfaces the first field-specific message, so the toast carries the actual reason (mime/size/etc).

## [13.2.4] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed

- **Type-safety sweep** — source now passes `vue-tsc --noEmit` and `eslint 'resources/js/**/*.{ts,vue}'` with zero errors and zero warnings.
    - `SkDatatable.vue` `activeFilters` widened to a single `FilterValue` union (`string | number | Date | (Date | null)[] | null`); DatePicker filters migrated from `v-model` to `:model-value` + `@update:model-value` with narrow casts.
    - `:icon` expression coerces trailing null to `undefined`; `datatable.records_info` pagination params are passed through `String(... ?? 0)` to match i18n string arguments.
    - `SelectOption` cast in `SkFormInput.vue` routed through `unknown`.
    - `router.reload({ preserveScroll: true })` calls reduced to `router.reload()` (Inertia v3 preserves scroll/state on reload by default).
- **Typed shared props aligned with runtime shape** — `SharedPageProps` gained a `[key: string]: unknown` index signature so it satisfies Inertia's `PageProps` constraint; `env.d.ts` now declares `sharedPageProps.auth` as `{ user, role, role_names, permissions }` plus `appEnv / appDebug / locale / availableLocales`.
- **Page-level prop/type fixes** — `Dashboard/Index.vue` reads `user?.first_name` (real field) instead of a non-existent `user?.name`; `Settings/Index.vue` declares `logo_url: string | null` on the `general` shape; `RoleForm.vue` calls Wayfinder as `update.url({ id: props.role!.id! })`.
- **ESLint warnings cleared** — `Breadcrumb.rootLabel`, `FileGrid.emptyLabel` and `SkTag.{value, icon, color, severity}` have `withDefaults` fallbacks; `SkDatatable` `v-html` usage is marked with a reasoned `eslint-disable-next-line` (render string is author-defined, `escapeHtml` helper is exposed).

### Changed

- **tsconfig deduplication** — `tsconfig.json` excludes `packages/**` and adds a new `"@lvntr/components/*"` path that resolves first to `resources/js/components/Lvntr-Starter-Kit/*` with a fallback to the package copy; the previous dual-include produced duplicate type-check errors for every synced component.
- **Vite `Components` plugin is single-source** — the `dirs` entry was trimmed to `resources/js/components` only; the package path is gone. The auto-generated `components.d.ts` now references source paths.
